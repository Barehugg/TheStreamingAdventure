 <p>&nbsp; My name is Barehugg, this book is to tell you a little bit about streaming, what it takes, and what to expect to get out of it. I started streaming in 2020 during the covid pandemic and have grown very fast ever since. I am a 100% disabled veteran but at the time was not rated at 100% yet, I had been laid off from work with no hope to return, we lost our house and alost lost everything.<br>&nbsp; I served in the military from 2011-2016 as a GSE(Gas Turbine Systems Electrician) in the US Navy. I have done many jobs that really put a strain on my body as it was already broken and weak from my military service, so finding another job that I could do with my background and that would be easy on my body was close to impossible, so my wife encouraged me to start streaming, even if i only made $20 a month, that would help us pay for diapers and I already played the games anyways.<br>&nbsp; So my streaming adventure started, it started off with reaching out to everyone around, asking friends and family for help to get it off the ground. I did tons of research up to 16 hours some days just figuring out what I could do better and what I could improve on to try to make it the best stream possible. All of this research and work I then passed on to others that asked or wanted help to try to help everyone as a whole, try to grow a community around helping one another and building each-other up.<br> &nbsp; When I started streaming I had a 10 year old computer, no screen I used a $20 TV with a stand made of wood I made, a headset that was duck-taped together, a mouse that did not scroll, and a keyboard with broken keys. After 1 year of streaming my community helped me afford all the things needed to give them a better experience and an entire computer set up that allows me to give them the best experience possible. Now I just want to pay it forward and pass the love onto others and reach out to help as many people out there as I can. <br> &nbsp; This led to having a very amazing community that loves helping one another and just wants to spread the love and joy to all that we meet, it took a lot of time and work to meet these people and to grow to what it is today, but it was 100% worth it and quite the adventure that I am very glad that I took. So if any of this information helps you or brings you joy or peace, just tell my wife and my community thank you!</p>
