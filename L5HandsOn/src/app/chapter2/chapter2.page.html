<p>&nbsp; So for streaming there is a LOT of equipment and add ons that you can do and get to stream, but if you are just getting started you do not need that much, so here we will go over the basics of what is really needed what is actually required for you to stream decently and grow with it. <br> &nbsp; For starters lets talk internet and computer specs, because the requirements for these will heavily depend on your streaming game of choice. If you want to stream a old classic game you can get away with streaming on an older graphics card around a 600-900 series card should perform well and an internet download speed of about 10mb and upload speed of about 5-10mb. If you want to go with a game with a bit higher resolution and a higher demand on your computer and internet, lets say League of Legends for example, you will want a video card around a 900-1600 series card, and you will want an internet speed of around 30-100mb download and 10-20mb upload speed. This will keep you from having lag issues or issues with the stream disconnecting and having a massive lag. <br> &nbsp; Each game has a system requirements to play that game, usually they will specify what kind of graphics, CPU, and internet is needed to play that game, typically you want to take those requirements and do about 1.5x that amount, due to the system running the game and streaming the game at the same time, it has to load most data twice. Also keep in mind your upload speed should be around 15-20 mb for an average game and around 20-30 for a high FPS high action type of game. You can always decrease and increase your bitrate(the amount of upload you want to go towards the stream) you should always leave at least a 2mb buffer away from the stream. So if you have a 10mb upload speed you should be safe with running at an 8k Bitrate. As well as you can adjust your Frames Per Second that you are streaming at and your resolution, these will increase or decrease the load you are putting on your GPU, know that overloading your GPU will make the stream lag behind and could result in overheating your GPU.<br>  </p>
