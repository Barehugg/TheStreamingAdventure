<p> &nbsp; As in all things there is always a massive list of don'ts so we will cover a lot of the do's and a few common mistakes for streaming here today. The first do will have to be BE RESPONSIVE, watch chat and always be willing to talk to someone when they are engaging with you. When someone takes time out of their day and out of the hundred of thousands of people streaming, they pick you and want to talk to you, the least you could do is respond and engage in communication with them. This does not mean to call out people "lurking"(watching but not talking) that is a for sure DON'T there are many people in the world that want to watch but do not want to talk, they just enjoy watching the game play and listening to the chatter going on. A good tip for being Responsive when just starting out is, if you do not have 2 screens yet, use your phone and watch the stream in the creator mode on twitch, this will give you chat live feed so you can respond as they are talking instead of the 10-30 second delay(the time it takes for chat to appear and for them to hear your response) watching your own stream will have with chat. <br> &nbsp; Ask questions, keep viewers engaged by asking about them, be courteous and ask how they are doing, what is going on in their lives. You may connect with people on a deeper level and have a permanent viewer instead of someone just stopping by to check it out and leaving to never come back. Connecting with people and being nice will go a long way when it comes to streaming. <br> &nbsp; Having a discord and a way for people to communicate with you while you are not live will help in growing a community and a group of people who want to engage with you and the stream will keep people engaged as well. This allows people to have separate conversations and have more than just you to focus on, so they can make more friends, and in doing this it will sometimes lead to Bit or donating wars amongst them, this will be benefit you and the stream more than they know. Don't ever ask for more though, Do not encourage donations or bits, do not ask for it, it will come in due time.<br> &nbsp;  Do not ask for any kind of compensation for what you are doing, they do not have to watch you, there is thousands of others to go watch, so make sure they feel as comfortable in your chat and stream as possible. This goes without saying, do not single anyone out, do not be demeaning or derogatory towards anyone. This will turn more than just that person away, most people will stand by one another and that is what you want in your chat and community, people that will stand by you. <br> &nbsp; So the last thing you want to do is make them feel bad for supporting you in any way. </p>
