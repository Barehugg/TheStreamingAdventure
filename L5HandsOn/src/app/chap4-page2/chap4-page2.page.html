  <p> &nbsp; Putting things like this around the background of your stream will help with people feeling welcome and a part of your life. Your background on camera is just as important as your stream itself. I can not tell you how many people have complained about another streamer just because they stream in their bedroom and it is always a mess. It may not hurt in the long run, but it sure will help in the growth process of streaming to keep yourself and your background as nice and tidy as possible. So shower, put on a nice shirt, and clean up a little before hitting that button to go live. Treat this like a job and you will get job type earnings back, if you treat it like you do not care and do not want anyone to feel welcome, you will get people who do not care in return. <br> &nbsp; Regardless of what you want to stream, or what kind of personality you want to use while streaming, there is people out there that will watch, the hardest part is finding them and keeping them engaged. So DO BE YOURSELF, do your thing and do not change who you are entirely just to do this or you will hate it. Streaming is not for everyone, do not force it, streaming is more about being an entertainer than about a gamer.</p>
