<p> &nbsp; There are a lot of things for streaming that you may WANT, but most of it is not needed. This is where we will cover a few of those things that you may want to spend your hard earned money on to make your stream look, sound, and feel more attractive to viewers. Most people want a good screen and a better GPU or to upgrade things for themselves to enhance game play and think that will make people want to watch more, but fact of the mater is honestly people who are there for you do not care how fast you see enemies or can react to the things happening, as long as the stream is not lagging and the sound quality is good, they are there for you. <br> &nbsp; Most people who watch streamers want to feel a connection with the streamer or are watching because they want to learn about how to play that game. If you are not one of the top players in that game streaming, they are more than likely not there to watch your playing, they came to watch you and get to know you. So spend that money on things to help that, a camera or a better camera, a better mic to help them hear you better, a better headset to be able to hear notifications from the stream better, or another screen so you can always read chat when someone wants to talk to you.<br> &nbsp; The main things I think are major upgrades for a stream is a camera number 1, a better mic, better lighting, and if you really want to go all out with streaming, a stream deck is definitely a great way to go, it will help you keep chat engaged with all sorts of buttons to activate sounds, scenes, pictures, gifs, or anything else your mind can thing up to activate during your stream. I have 2 and I could not stream without them, they are a massive help and allow me to focus more on making content than swapping scenes or tabbing to change or activate something.<br> &nbsp; Once you have upgraded the viewers part of the stream the other things to focus on is the stream itself, get custom emotes, custom scenes, or rewards for the viewers. These will help people engage in the stream and give them goals to achieve on your stream at the same time as supporting you in your dream. You want to reward your viewers and supporters first, then you can reward yourself once you have given back all you can. Think of it like a business, for the first year 100% of all earnings should go back into the business, after that you can take some but most of it should still go back into it, this will allow the stream to keep growing and keep snowballing into something better.</p><br>
