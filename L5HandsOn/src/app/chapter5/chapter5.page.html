  <p> &nbsp; There is countless tips for growing your stream but a few of my favorites are NETWORK, network, and Network. Always reach out, "shameless plug", and get your name out there. This does not mean to be annoying by constantly asking for people to join or follow, this just means talk to people be a person, lightly mention it, and let them ask about your stream. Do not bring it up on your own, allow the conversation to steer its way into gaming or streaming, and then you can mention it. If you are in someone elses stream, do not blast that you stream too, its a really bad look, instead just talk to them and ask them questions, maybe they will give you some good incite and that may help you more in the long run that just blasting that you stream. Your name is your brand and you do not want to tarnish your brand by over promoting, but you also do not want to under-promote either because then no-one will find you. There is a healthy balance and a good time for everything in life. <br> &nbsp; Another really good tip for trying to grow, NEVER end your stream. This does not mean keep your stream up forever, it just means do not simply END your stream, raid someone else instead. Raiding other streamers not only helps them by you spreading the love of those lurking or giving your viewers another person to watch, but it shows other streamers and communities that you also stream and have interest in them. This usually comes back to you in them and their viewers wanting to come check you out and see what you are all about. This is a good way to promote your stream without actually saying anything about you streaming, this does not mean to go raid people with 100 thousand viewers, most people will just ignore that completely, and it comes and goes so fast they will never see it. If you want to raid someone, keep near your own average viewers, this will allow the communities to mesh and meet one another, rather than just raid and they all disappear. <br> &nbsp; There are some really cool websites that will help you find people to raid, one of my all time favorites is <a>https://sullygnome.com/</a> this website will allow you to look up your profile, then you can favorite the RAID FINDER page, that will allow you to go to that page and find someone to raid based on your requirements that is live right then at that time. Things like this are things that you want to look for in trying to grow your stream, find little tricks and neat programs that will allow you to engage with new people and meet all sorts of people in the world. <br> &nbsp; Another good way to promote your stream is making videos, the thing about videos is that you cant just make a good game play video. Good plays and awesome things done in game are all over the place, that is not what people look for in a video. When was the last time you went to YouTube and searched for a good game play of a video, or even searched for your own video and had it come up. You have to make your video different and entertaining, you want something that someone will watch and then tell all their friends about it.</p>
